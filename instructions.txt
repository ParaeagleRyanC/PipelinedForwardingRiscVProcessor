How the game works:
	This program is the final project for the class. 
	This represents the "eliminate-invaders" game.
	Russians have invaded Ukraine.
	A total of 8 invaders are scattered across the screen.
	'PT' stands for Putin. 'Z', 'theta', and 'stars' as Russian invaders. 
	You start off at the top left corner as a 'hammer'.
	At the bottom right of the screen is a comrade of yours that you are to safe.
	You eliminate the enemies and safe your friend by simply going over the symbols.
	You are to work your way around the map and eliminate ALL invaders
	before you can safe your friend. In other words, going to your friend
	prior to all enemies are eliminated will not work.
	As an enemy is eliminated, a tomb stone with a cross will be placesd at the location.
	The seven-segment will display the current number of invaders you have eliminated.
	The LEDs will lit up as you successfully save your comrade.
	The game is restarted upon a BTNC press or when you have saved your comrade.
	You can control movement by pressing the four directional buttons.

Number of additional fonts created and used: 7 

How to set up:
1) Open up a terminal on your machine
2) Enter vivado environment
3) Execute the following command to update font (be sure to have a working checkpoint in place of final_io.dcp)
vivado -mode batch -source ../resources/load_mem.tcl -tclargs updateFont final_io.dcp project_font.txt project_font.bit project_font.dcp
4) Execute the following command to create project_background.mem file
python3 ../resources/generate_background.py project_background.txt project_background.mem
5) Execute the following command to update background
vivado -mode batch -source ../resources/load_mem.tcl -tclargs updateBackground project_font.dcp project_background.mem project_background.bit project_background.dcp
6) Execute the following command to update memory files in preparation for generating bit stream file
java -jar ../resources/rars1_4.jar mc CompactTextAtZero a \
  dump .text HexText project_text.mem \
  dump .data HexText project_data.mem \
  dump .text SegmentWindow project_s.txt \
  project.s
7) Execute the following command to generate bit stream file
vivado -mode batch -source ../resources/load_mem.tcl -tclargs updateMem project_background.dcp project_text.mem project_data.mem project_game.bit
8) In a new terminal without vivado environment, execute the following command to program your FPGA board.
python3 ../resources/openocd.py project_game.bit
